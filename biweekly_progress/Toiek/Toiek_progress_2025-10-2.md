Accomplishment

* Find the transcribing model that suit for running locally  
* Create a function to get the speech to text using the transcribing model that I found  
* Print out the result of the speech to text inside the streamlit dashboard

Challenges

* It takes too much time to run, and it doesn’t even print out the result of the transcribed text  
* I wasted a lot of time thinking that it would work just give it time but actually it doesn’t
